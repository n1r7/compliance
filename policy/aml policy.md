# Anti-Money Laundering Policy

## Introduction
Novi Financial (Novi) maintains a global anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to fulfil Novi's legal and regulatory obligations to monitor for the potentially suspicious use of digital wallets on the Libra Payment System (Libra). The program comprises interconnected protocols that are 

# Risk Management
Many organizations use the _lines of defense_ model for risk management (Financial Stability Institute "Four Lines of Defense Model"). With this model, risk-management responsibilities are divided into general categories.
1. First line of defense: Business operations
    - As the first line of defense, businesses are responsible for assessing and managing the risks posted by their products. To that end, the first line of defense, with the support of the second line, is responsible for verifying that product offerings, processes, and operations are lawful and managed appropriately.
2. Second line of defense: Compliance and risk functions
    - The second line of defense is responsible for monitoring and reporting risk-related practices and information, and overseeing compliance-related issues. The second line of defense sets standards for lawful and ethical business operations. The second line of defense aids the first line in identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling risks.
3. Third line of defense: Audit
    - The third line of defense provides to management and the Board of Directors its assessment of the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and internal controls.
    




    
## Program componenets
- **Policies** outline how Novi ensures it conducts business lawfully.
- **Processes** implement policies.
- **Procedures** describe how to run processes.
- **Controls** evaluate risks, manage execution, and test effectiveness.


# Monitoring
Transaction monitoring entails the automated or manual review of transactions to identify activity of concern; when appropriate, report it to authorities; and evaluate whether customer relationships should be discontinued (Wolsberg Group Statement on AML Screening, Monitoring, and Searching, 2009). Novi's transaction-monitoring strategy calls for:
- A comprehensive understanding of products offered by Novi, which enables identification of their money-laundering vulnerabilities;
- Thorough and clear documentation and governance, which are pillars of a sustainable program; and
- Technologies that can help Novi prevent, detect, and report financial crime, mitigate compliance risk, and protect against abuse of Libra.

## Risk-based process
Novi's monitoring program uses a framework based on four concepts:
1. **Typologies**, which are classifications of money-laundering behavior
2. **Behaviors**, which are a discrete type or set of user-initiated activities
3. **Red flags**, which are risky behaviors
3. **Rules**, which use calculations to generate alerts.


## Product Risks
Money laundering is the criminal practice of processing illicit funds throuhg a series of transactions designed to "clean" the funds so they appear to be the proceeds of lawful activity (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council). The _enable, distance, and disguise_ model (Stephen Platt, Criminal Capital: How the Finance Industry Facilitates Crime) describes money laundering in terms of the objectives of the criminal, who seeks to:
- Succeed in perpetrating a crime
- Avoid detection
- Benefit from the crime
- Retain those benefits
