# Anti-Money Laundering Policy

## Introduction
Novi Financial (Novi) maintains a global anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to fulfil Novi's legal and regulatory obligations to monitor for the potentially suspicious use of digital wallets on the Libra Payment System (Libra). The program comprises interconnected protocols that are 

# Risk Management
Many organizations use the _lines of defense_ model for risk management (Financial Stability Institute "Four Lines of Defense Model"). With this model, risk-management responsibilities are divided into general categories.
1. First line of defense: Business operations
    - As the first line of defense, businesses are responsible for assessing and managing the risks posted by their products. To that end, the first line of defense, with the support of the second line, is responsible for verifying that product offerings, processes, and operations are lawful and managed appropriately.
2. Second line of defense: Compliance and risk functions
    - The second line of defense is responsible for monitoring and reporting risk-related practices and information, and overseeing compliance-related issues. The second line of defense sets standards for lawful and ethical business operations. The second line of defense aids the first line in identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling risks.
3. Third line of defense: Audit
    - The third line of defense provides to management and the Board of Directors its assessment of the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and internal controls.
    




    
## Program componenets
- **Policies** outline how Novi ensures it conducts business lawfully.
- **Processes** implement policies.
- **Procedures** describe how to run processes.
- **Controls** evaluate risks, manage execution, and test effectiveness.


# Monitoring
Transaction monitoring entails the automated or manual review of transactions to identify activity of concern; when appropriate, report it to authorities; and evaluate whether customer relationships should be discontinued (Wolsberg Group Statement on AML Screening, Monitoring, and Searching, 2009). Novi's transaction-monitoring strategy calls for:
- A comprehensive understanding of products offered by Novi, which enables identification of their money-laundering vulnerabilities;
- Thorough and clear documentation and governance, which are pillars of a sustainable program; and
- Technologies that can help Novi prevent, detect, and report financial crime, mitigate compliance risk, and protect against abuse of Libra.

## Risk-based process
Novi's monitoring program uses a framework based on four concepts:
1. **Typologies**, which are classifications of money-laundering behavior
2. **Behaviors**, which are a discrete type or set of user-initiated activities
3. **Red flags**, which are risky behaviors
3. **Rules**, which use calculations to generate alerts.


## Product Risks
###Money Laundering
Money laundering is the criminal practice of processing illicit funds throuhg a series of transactions designed to "clean" the funds so they appear to be the proceeds of lawful activity (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council). 

The _enable, distance, and disguise_ model (Stephen Platt, Criminal Capital: How the Finance Industry Facilitates Crime) describes money laundering in terms of the objectives of the criminal, who seeks to:
- Succeed in perpetrating a crime
- Avoid detection
- Benefit from the crime
- Retain those benefits

Money laundering is a diverse and often complex process. From a financial perspective, it occurs via one or more discrete steps:
1. **Placement**: Introducing illicit funds into Libra, ideally without attracting the attention of financial institutions or law enforcement.
2. **Layering**: Moving funds within Libra and the broader financial system, often in a complex series of transactions, to create confusion about the source of funds and complicate the transaction trail.
3. **Integration**: The ultimate goal of money laundering--using ilicit funds to purchase licit goods and services.

The _enable, distance, disguise_ model takes into account that a criminal can make beneficial use of illicit funds (i.e. launder them) without ever placing, layering, or integrating them. In either model, the underlying question is the same: _What advantage does the product or service confer upon a user?_ It is critical to understand how a product's features make it vulnerable to money laundering, and to what extect existing limits and controls mitigate that risk.

### Terrorist Financing
There is no universal definition of terrorism, but U.S. law is instructive in defining it as violet or dangerous acts that appear to be intended to:
- Intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
- Influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or
- Affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage taking.

**Terrorist financing** is the provision or collection of funds with the intent that they be used, or with the knowledge that they will be used, in full or in part, to carry out an act of terrorism. The funds used for terrorist financing can be funds of any kind, however acquired (18 U.S.C. 2339C).

In contrast to money laundering, which involves the disguising of funds derived from illegal activity so they may be used without detection of the illegal activity, terrorist financing can involve the use of legally derived money to carry out illegal activities. The objective of money laundering is financial gain or the disguising of illicit proceeds, whereas with terrorism, the objective is to promote the agenda or cause of the terrorist organization. Both money launderers and terrorists, however, attempt to disguise the association between themselves and their funding sources.

Money laundering techniques “are essentially the same as those used to conceal the sources of, and uses for, terrorist financing. Funds used to support terrorism may originate from legitimate sources, criminal activities, or both. Nonetheless, disguising the source of terrorist financing, regardless of whether the source is of legitimate or illicit origin, is important. If the source can be concealed, it remains available for future terrorist financing activities. Similarly, it is important for terrorists to conceal the use of the funds so that the financing activity goes undetected.” (World Bank Reference Guide to Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism)

There is an overlap between money laundering and terrorist financing:

### Tax Avoidance

The shadow economy comprises activity that if it were legitimate, would be taxable, and laundering money entails converting illicit funds into apparently licit funds. Funds derived from or related to tax crimes require laundering in the same way that any other types of illegally gotten gains do (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Money Laundering Awareness Handbook for Tax Examiners and Tax Auditors).  Indeed, “[c]riminals will seek to launder the proceeds from their crimes to pay for [luxury goods] in order to avoid detection by the tax or law enforcement authorities.”  After surveying 19 countries, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that “[m]ost countries report that the strategies and techniques used by their tax authorities to detect tax evasion and money laundering” specifically related to identity fraud were “successful in terms of:

- Improving identification of suitable cases to audit;
- Preventing revenue loss through proactive data mining;
- Enabling the prosecution of cases that otherwise may have never been detected; and
- Providing the quickest opportunity to review returns that potentially use a stolen identify before the refunds are issued and thereby likely irretrievable.” (Report on Identity Fraud: Tax Evasion and Money Laundering Vulnerabilities, Centre for Tax Policy and Administration)

The Tax Justice Network, a tax-related think tank, reports that as of 2010, using conservative estimates, as much as US$32 trillion in global private wealth was “invested virtually tax-free through the world’s still-expanding black hole of more than 80 ‘offshore’ secrecy jurisdictions.” (James S. Henry, The Price of Offshore Revisited: New Estimates for “Missing” Global Private Wealth, Income, Inequality, and Lost Taxes, Tax Justice Network (2012))
