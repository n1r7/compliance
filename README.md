**Strategies**
1. Maximize communication: Am I doing what I need to do? Am I communicating as such?
2. Measure efficiency: How do I know I am doing what I need to? What are my costs?

**Clear communication of:**
1. How do I know I can trust this transaction?
2. How do I know I can trust this user?
3. How often have I assisted with a law enforcement initiative?
4. How many former users have been convicted?

**Effectiveness is the culture.**
1. We know with certainty we fulfil our requirements. 
2. Help law enforcement fight crime that harms our users.

Novi Financial (Novi) maintains a global anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to fulfil Novi's legal and regulatory obligations to monitor for the potentially suspicious use of digital wallets on the Libra Payment System (Libra). The program comprises interconnected protocols that are 

# WHY WE CARE
### The Shadow Economy
The shadow economy is “the market-based production of and payment for legal goods and services that are deliberately concealed from public authorities”.[^1]  Also called the underground, informal, or parallel economy, the shadow economy includes not only illegal activities, but also unreported income from the production of legal goods and services, either from monetary or barter transactions. In other words, the shadow economy comprises all economic activities that would generally be taxable were they reported to the tax authorities.[^2]

Underground economies can typically be classified in one or more different ways:[^3]
1. The **illegal economy** consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce.
    - Illegal activities that involve monetary transactions include:[^4]
        - Trade in stolen goods;
        - Drug manufacturing, trafficking, and dealing;
        - Prostitution;
        - Gambling; 
        - Smuggling; 
        - Fraud; 
        - Human trafficking; and 
        - Weapons trafficking.
2.	The **unreported economy** consists of those economic activities that circumvent or evade the institutionally established fiscal rules as codified in tax code.
    - A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported.
3.	The **unrecorded economy** consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.
    - A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, which represents a discrepancy between total income or output and the actual amount of income or output captured or enumerated by the statistical accounting system designed to measure economic activity.
4.	The **informal economy** comprises those economic activities that circumvent the costs and are excluded from the benefits and rights incorporated in the laws and administrative rules covering property relationships, commercial licensing, labor contracts, tors, financial credit, and social security systems.

The shadow economy accounts for approximately 16 percent of the global economy; however, developing and transition countries have disproportionally large shadow economies, averaging between 26 and 34 percent of the local economies.

### Why prices continue to increase

Money from the illegal economy has to go somewhere – people cannot pay for everything with or hold an infinite amount of physical currency. Funds from the illegal economy flow to where they are most productive.

For a given market of a product (encompasses all goods and services), demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price. People value products differently than one another. For example, two potential tenants may value an apartment differently – one potential tenant sees $1,500 per month as a value, while the other sees $1,500 as overpriced. While this difference could be for a combination of reasons, generally, high prices will limit most people’s ability to afford a given product.

Prices for legal goods and services _should_ be driven by demand from the legal economy. In this utopic world, all people have legal employment and contribute to economic growth through taxes collected. When people do not 

Participants of the legal economy and illegal economy demand products from the legal economy equally, i.e., every person has the same basic needs (water, food, shelter) that are provided by the legal economy. An increase in demand without a corresponding increase in supply leads to higher prices. These price increases impact more than the demand for expensive items typically considered valuable assets (e.g., real estate, art, jewelry). Everyday expenses, such as rent, groceries, and transportation are also affected. Individuals who profit from the illegal economy inflate demand and increase prices every time they introduce illegally obtained funds into the legal economy.

The economic impact of illegal economy is worsened because most profit from the illegal shadow economy is not taxed appropriately, resulting in reduced income for countries.

### Money Laundering
In general, money laundering is _the conversion or transfer of property knowing that it is derived from a criminal offense for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or helping others to do so_.[^11]  Under U.S. law, to be criminally liable for money laundering, “a defendant must conduct or attempt to conduct a financial transaction[] knowing that the property involved in the financial transaction represents the proceeds of some unlawful activity, with one of […] four specific intents […] and the property must in fact be derived from a specified unlawful activity.”[^12]

Money laundering is the criminal practice of processing illicit funds throuhg a series of transactions designed to "clean" the funds so they appear to be the proceeds of lawful activity (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council). 

The _enable, distance, and disguise_ model (Stephen Platt, Criminal Capital: How the Finance Industry Facilitates Crime) describes money laundering in terms of the objectives of the criminal, who seeks to:
- Succeed in perpetrating a crime
- Avoid detection
- Benefit from the crime
- Retain those benefits

![alt text](https://github.com/nirvanapatel/compliance/blob/master/images/Enable%20Distance%20Disguise.png?raw=true)

Money laundering is a diverse and often complex process. From a financial perspective, it occurs via one or more discrete steps:
1. **Placement**: Introducing illicit funds into Libra, ideally without attracting the attention of financial institutions or law enforcement.
2. **Layering**: Moving funds within Libra and the broader financial system, often in a complex series of transactions, to create confusion about the source of funds and complicate the transaction trail.
3. **Integration**: The ultimate goal of money laundering--using ilicit funds to purchase licit goods and services.

![alt text](https://github.com/nirvanapatel/compliance/blob/master/images/Placement%20Layering%20Integration.png?raw=true)

The _enable, distance, disguise_ model takes into account that a criminal can make beneficial use of illicit funds (i.e. launder them) without ever placing, layering, or integrating them. In either model, the underlying question is the same: _What advantage does the product or service confer upon a user?_ It is critical to understand how a product's features make it vulnerable to money laundering, and to what extect existing limits and controls mitigate that risk.

### Terrorist Financing
There is no universal definition of terrorism, but U.S. law is instructive in defining it as violet or dangerous acts that appear to be intended to:
- Intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
- Influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or
- Affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage taking.

**Terrorist financing** is the provision or collection of funds with the intent that they be used, or with the knowledge that they will be used, in full or in part, to carry out an act of terrorism. The funds used for terrorist financing can be funds of any kind, however acquired (18 U.S.C. 2339C).

In contrast to money laundering, which involves the disguising of funds derived from illegal activity so they may be used without detection of the illegal activity, terrorist financing can involve the use of legally derived money to carry out illegal activities. The objective of money laundering is financial gain or the disguising of illicit proceeds, whereas with terrorism, the objective is to promote the agenda or cause of the terrorist organization. Both money launderers and terrorists, however, attempt to disguise the association between themselves and their funding sources.

Money laundering techniques “are essentially the same as those used to conceal the sources of, and uses for, terrorist financing. Funds used to support terrorism may originate from legitimate sources, criminal activities, or both. Nonetheless, disguising the source of terrorist financing, regardless of whether the source is of legitimate or illicit origin, is important. If the source can be concealed, it remains available for future terrorist financing activities. Similarly, it is important for terrorists to conceal the use of the funds so that the financing activity goes undetected.”[^13]

There is an overlap between money laundering and terrorist financing:

### Tax Avoidance

The shadow economy comprises activity that if it were legitimate, would be taxable, and laundering money entails converting illicit funds into apparently licit funds. Funds derived from or related to tax crimes require laundering in the same way that any other types of illegally gotten gains do.[^14]  Indeed, “[c]riminals will seek to launder the proceeds from their crimes to pay for [luxury goods] in order to avoid detection by the tax or law enforcement authorities.”[^15]  After surveying 19 countries, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that “[m]ost countries report that the strategies and techniques used by their tax authorities to detect tax evasion and money laundering” specifically related to identity fraud were “successful in terms of:

- Improving identification of suitable cases to audit;
- Preventing revenue loss through proactive data mining;
- Enabling the prosecution of cases that otherwise may have never been detected; and
- Providing the quickest opportunity to review returns that potentially use a stolen identify before the refunds are issued and thereby likely irretrievable.”[^16]

The Tax Justice Network, a tax-related think tank, reports that as of 2010, using conservative estimates, as much as US$32 trillion in global private wealth was “invested virtually tax-free through the world’s still-expanding black hole of more than 80 ‘offshore’ secrecy jurisdictions.”[^17]



### Criminalization of Money Laundering

The International Monetary Fund estimates that laundered funds represent between two and five percent of global gross domestic product.[^5]  Using World Bank estimates for GDP and applying IMF's estimate, between $1.75 trillion and $4.38 trillion were laundered in 2019. Criminality is profitable.

In part in response to the scale of the problem, multiple international treaties call for the criminalization of money laundering as a starting point for any AML/CTF regime:
- United Nationals Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) (Vienna Convention)
- United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (2000) (Palermo Convention)

Criminalization of money laundering in accordance with these conventions is FATF’s first recommendation.[^7]  As international standards have developed, the range of predicate offenses for money laundering has grown.[^8]  The Vienna Convention, Palermo Convention, and FATF Recommendation 1 call for “apply[ing] the crime of money laundering to all serious offenses, with a view to including the widest range of offenses as money laundering predicate offenses.”[^9]

### Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Regulations

Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) laws and regulations help protect the international financial system from abuse, which promotes the integrity of that system and contributes to its safety and security.[^10]  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) enumerates 11 pillars of a sound AML/CTF regime that the FATF assesses as part of its ongoing evaluation of countries’ performance in fighting the shadow economy:

| Num |	COMPONENT |	DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1  | Risk, policy, and coordination | Money laundering and terrorist financing risks are understood and, where appropriate, actions coordinated domestically to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation. |
| 2  | International cooperation | International cooperation delivers appropriate information, financial intelligence, and evidence, and facilitates action against criminals and their assets. |
| 3  | Supervision | Supervisors appropriately supervise, monitor[,] and regulate financial institutions and DNFBPs [designated non-financial businesses and professions] for compliance with AML/CFT requirements commensurate with their risks. |
| 4  | Preventive measures | Financial institutions and DNFBPs adequately apply AML/CFT preventive measures commensurate with their risks, and report suspicious transactions. |
| 5  | Legal persons and arrangements | Legal persons and arrangements are prevented from misuse for money laundering or terrorist financing, and information on their beneficial ownership is available to competent authorities without impediments. |
| 6  | Financial intelligence | Financial intelligence and all other relevant information are appropriately used by competent authorities for money laundering and terrorist financing investigations. |
| 7  | Money laundering investigation and prosecution | Money laundering [offenses] and activities are investigated and offenders are prosecuted and subject to effective, proportionate[,] and dissuasive sanctions. |
| 8  | Confiscation | Proceeds and instrumentalities of crime are confiscated. |
| 9  | Terrorist financing investigation and prosecution | Terrorist financing offenses and activities are investigated and persons who finance terrorism are prosecuted and subject to effective, proportionate[,] and dissuasive sanctions |
| 10 | Terrorist financing preventive measures and financial sanctions | Terrorists, terrorist organizations[,] and terrorist financiers are prevented from raising, moving[,] and using funds, and from abusing the NPO sector. |
| 11 | Proliferation financial sanctions | Persons and entities involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are prevented from raising, moving[,] and using funds, consistent with the relevant [UN Security Council Resolutions] |


# WHAT WE DO

The Libra Payment System was designed to be secure and safe. Because the Libra database is based on merkle trees, each transaction on the network is referenceable, and each component of each transaction is verified. These unique properties strengthen and streamline risk and compliance processes. 

The safest payment system is one based on trust. If members share information and work together to fight financial crime, the system itself becomes safer and more efficient. Information sharing programs exist to assist in the fight against financial crime. However, those programs are inefficient due to a lack of central governance, standards, and accountability. Novi seeks to avoid these shorcomings. 

To effectively fight financial crime, Libra members must:
- Collectively validate users of the network
- Share intelligence and detection models
- Work together to continuously improve

Novi's AML program is based on trust. Much like Libra, it uses distributed ledgers and merkle trees to ensure appropriate information is collected and verified, and available for review. 
- We verify all users, so they can transact quickly and with confidence
- We review every transaction, so Libra can remain secure and safe
- We communicate with our regulators and collaborate with peers on building effective controls

Novi's AML compliance framework links and validates user information, and allows activity across the entire network to be monitored.
- Shared data creates connections between users.
- Participants can verify source of funds for each transaction.
- Transactions include wallet hosts, , and monitors transactions between users
- Participants will be unable to see private data (all data is encrypted)

### Risk Management
Many organizations use the _lines of defense_ model for risk management (Financial Stability Institute "Four Lines of Defense Model"). With this model, risk-management responsibilities are divided into general categories.
1. First line of defense: Business operations
    - As the first line of defense, businesses are responsible for assessing and managing the risks posted by their products. To that end, the first line of defense, with the support of the second line, is responsible for verifying that product offerings, processes, and operations are lawful and managed appropriately.
2. Second line of defense: Compliance and risk functions
    - The second line of defense is responsible for monitoring and reporting risk-related practices and information, and overseeing compliance-related issues. The second line of defense sets standards for lawful and ethical business operations. The second line of defense aids the first line in identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling risks.
3. Third line of defense: Audit
    - The third line of defense provides to management and the Board of Directors its assessment of the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and internal controls.
    
Libra's unique features and Novi's immutable AML database impact the traditional lines of defense model. By making compliance an inherent part of the transaction process, Novi can prove it has fulfilled its compliance obligations.
1. First line of defense
    - Product risks are mitigated through the transaction processing process, which has build-in controls based on Move
2. Second line of defense
    - Requirements are implemented as protocols
3. Third line of defense
    - The entire program is transparent and queryable


    
### Program componenets
- **Policies** outline how Novi ensures it conducts business lawfully.
- **Processes** implement policies.
- **Procedures** describe how to run processes.
- **Controls** evaluate risks, manage execution, and test effectiveness.


### Users



### Monitoring
Transaction monitoring entails the automated or manual review of transactions to identify activity of concern; when appropriate, report it to authorities; and evaluate whether customer relationships should be discontinued (Wolsberg Group Statement on AML Screening, Monitoring, and Searching, 2009). Novi's transaction-monitoring strategy calls for:
- A comprehensive understanding of products offered by Novi, which enables identification of their money-laundering vulnerabilities;
- Thorough and clear documentation and governance, which are pillars of a sustainable program; and
- Technologies that can help Novi prevent, detect, and report financial crime, mitigate compliance risk, and protect against abuse of Libra.

Novi's monitoring program targets the interconnectedness of Libra. 

Novi's monitoring program uses a framework based on four concepts:
1. **Typologies**, which are classifications of money-laundering behavior
2. **Behaviors**, which are a discrete type or set of user-initiated activities
3. **Red flags**, which are risky behaviors
3. **Rules**, which use calculations to generate alerts.


1. Identify systems.  
2. Identify connections between systems.  
3. Define system participant roles.  
4. Define normal behavior for each role.  
5. What are the features of that behavior?  

6. Observe user behavior on system.
7. Measure distance between role behavior and user behavior.
8. Cluster measurements.

9. Create graph = V(user)-send money->V(user)

    Properties of users = 
    ```
        {
          "unique_id": string,
          "Roles": tuple(string),
          "Feature_scores": tuple(float),
          "money_sent": float,
          "money_received": float,
          "transaction_count": int
        }
     ```  

    Properties of money_send = 
    ```
        {
          "originator_id": string,
          "beneficiary_id": string,
          "transaction_time": timedate,
          "transaction_amt": float
        }
     ```
