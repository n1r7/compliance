Compliance comes down to:
1. Maximizing communication: Am I doing what I need to do? Am I communicating as such?
2. Measuring efficiency: How do I know I am doing what I need to? What are my costs?

Effectiveness is the culture.  
1. We know with certainty we fulfil our requirements. 
2. Help law enforcement fight crime that harms our users.

The program is clear communication of:
1. How do I know I can trust this transaction?
2. How do I know I can trust this user?
3. How often have I assisted with a law enforcement initiative?
4. How many former users have been convicted?
