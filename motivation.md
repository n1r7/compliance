# THE SHADOW ECONOMY
The shadow economy is “the market-based production of and payment for legal goods and services that are deliberately concealed from public authorities”.[^1]  Also called the underground, informal, or parallel economy, the shadow economy includes not only illegal activities, but also unreported income from the production of legal goods and services, either from monetary or barter transactions. In other words, the shadow economy comprises all economic activities that would generally be taxable were they reported to the tax authorities.[^2]

Underground economies can typically be classified in one or more different ways:[^3]
1. The illegal economy consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statues defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce. Illegal activities that involve monetary transactions include: trade in stolen goods; drug manufacturing, trafficking, and dealing; prostitution; gambling; smuggling; fraud; human trafficking; and weapons trafficking.[^4]
2.	The unreported economy consists of those economic activities that circumvent or evade the institutionally established fiscal rules as codified in tax code. A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported.
3.	The unrecorded economy consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies. A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, which represents a discrepancy between total income or output and the actual amount of income or output captured or enumerated by the statistical accounting system designed to measure economic activity.
4.	The informal economy comprises those economic activities that circumvent the costs and are excluded from the benefits and rights incorporated in the laws and administrative rules covering property relationships, commercial licensing, labor contracts, tors, financial credit, and social security systems.

The shadow economy accounts for approximately 16 percent of the global economy; however, developing and transition countries have disproportionally large shadow economies, averaging between 26 and 34 percent of the local economies.

## Why prices continue to increase

Money from the illegal economy has to go somewhere – one cannot pay for everything with or hold an infinite amount of physical currency. Funds from the illegal economy flow to where they are most productive.

For a given market of a product (encompasses all goods and services), demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price. People value products differently than one another. For example, two potential tenants may value an apartment differently – one potential tenant sees $1,500 per month as a value, while the other sees $1,500 as overpriced. While this difference could be for a combination of reasons, generally, high prices will limit most people’s ability to afford a given product.

Prices for legal goods and services should be driven by demand from the legal economy. In this utopic world, all people have legal employment and contribute to economic growth through taxes collected. When people do not 

Participants of the legal economy and illegal economy demand products from the legal economy equally, i.e., every person has the same basic needs (water, food, shelter), which are provided by the legal economy. An increase in demand without a corresponding increase in supply leads to higher prices. These price increases impact more than the demand for expensive items typically thought of ways to store assets (e.g., real estate, art, jewelry). Everyday expenses, such as rent, groceries, and transportation are also affected. Individuals who profit from the illegal economy inflate demand and increase prices every time they introduce illegally obtained funds into the legal economy.

The economic impact of illegal economy is worsened because most profit from the illegal shadow economy is not taxed appropriately, resulting in reduced income for countries.


# THE FIGHT AGAINST PROFITING FROM THE SHADOW ECONOMY

### Criminalization of Money Laundering

The International Monetary Fund estimates that laundered funds represent between two and five per cent of global gross domestic product.[^5]  “Using 1996 statistics, these percentages would approximate between US $590 billion and US $1.5 trillion.”[^6]

In part in response to the scale of the problem, multiple international treaties call for the criminalization of money laundering as a starting point for any AML/CTF regime:
- United Nationals Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) (Vienna Convention)
- United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (2000) (Palermo Convention)

Criminalization of money laundering in accordance with these conventions is FATF’s first recommendation.[^7]  As international standards have developed, the range of predicate offenses for money laundering has grown.[^8]  The Vienna Convention, Palermo Convention, and FATF Recommendation 1 call for “apply[ing] the crime of money laundering to all serious offenses, with a view to including the widest range of offenses as money laundering predicate offenses.”[^9]

### Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Regulations

Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) laws and regulations help protect the international financial system from abuse, which promotes the integrity of that system and contributes to its safety and security.[^10]  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) enumerates 11 pillars of a sound AML/CTF regime that the FATF assesses as part of its ongoing evaluation of countries’ performance in fighting the shadow economy:

| Num |	COMPONENT |	DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1  | Risk, policy, and coordination | Money laundering and terrorist financing risks are understood and, where appropriate, actions coordinated domestically to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation. |
| 2  | International cooperation | International cooperation delivers appropriate information, financial intelligence, and evidence, and facilitates action against criminals and their assets. |
| 3  | Supervision | Supervisors appropriately supervise, monitor[,] and regulate financial institutions and DNFBPs [designated non-financial businesses and professions] for compliance with AML/CFT requirements commensurate with their risks. |
| 4  | Preventive measures | Financial institutions and DNFBPs adequately apply AML/CFT preventive measures commensurate with their risks, and report suspicious transactions. |
| 5  | Legal persons and arrangements | Legal persons and arrangements are prevented from misuse for money laundering or terrorist financing, and information on their beneficial ownership is available to competent authorities without impediments. |
| 6  | Financial intelligence | Financial intelligence and all other relevant information are appropriately used by competent authorities for money laundering and terrorist financing investigations. |
| 7  | Money laundering investigation and prosecution | Money laundering [offenses] and activities are investigated and offenders are prosecuted and subject to effective, proportionate[,] and dissuasive sanctions. |
| 8  | Confiscation | Proceeds and instrumentalities of crime are confiscated. |
| 9  | Terrorist financing investigation and prosecution | Terrorist financing offenses and activities are investigated and persons who finance terrorism are prosecuted and subject to effective, proportionate[,] and dissuasive sanctions |
| 10 | Terrorist financing preventive measures and financial sanctions | Terrorists, terrorist organizations[,] and terrorist financiers are prevented from raising, moving[,] and using funds, and from abusing the NPO sector. |
| 11 | Proliferation financial sanctions | Persons and entities involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are prevented from raising, moving[,] and using funds, consistent with the relevant [UN Security Council Resolutions] |
