# Risks

Similar to fiat currency, virtual assets can be used to facilitate crime. However, unlike fiat currency, virtual assets have certain qualities that reduce the risk of misuse.

| Fiat | Virtual |
| ---- | ------- |
| Incomplete data | Complete data |
| Untraceable | Traceable |

If one was to design a risk-free payment system, what qualities would it have?
- Changes to the system are recorded and are immutable
- All valid payments are processed
- No invalid payments are processed
- Payments are instantaneous
- All users of the system are trusted

Virtual asset systems include these qualities.
- The blockchain ensures all changes are recorded and verified
    - Changes can be reviewed at each point in time
- Consensus protocols ensure all transactions are invalid
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance has high throughput, ensuring transactions are processed quickly
- Trust can be a feature of each user
