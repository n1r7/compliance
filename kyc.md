### Types of information

Company-initiated:
- All customer information required by law
- All customer information required by the bank
- All customer information requested by the bank
   - Non-customer-incentivized
      - Optional online form fields  
      - In-person information gathering  
      - Electronic information gathering  
      - Mail campaigns  

   - Customer-incentivized program
      - Customers that do not have or use certain risky features do not require monitoring for typologies that involve that feature  
         - The fewer the number of customers that require monitoring, the more efficient the AML program can be, reducing costs  
            - SARs require teams of educated humans to do things – they can never be eliminated  
         - Incentivizing users to reduce their threats to our system, we can reduce cost per SAR, thereby freeing up resources once allocated to the AML compliance function  
      - Feature limits  
         - For each risky feature the customer does not opt-in to, provide customer the equivalent in points of the average cost per SAR involving a product with that feature  
         - Products have tiered features customers opt-into  
            - Riskier product features require additional information from the customer    
      - Payment source identification  
         - Identification of the source of funds reduces the largest risk of payments  
         - White list payments from confirmed sources utilizing the 314(b) process, requiring regular checks to confirm the connection
      - Social network connectivity  
         - Improve watch list and sanctions screening effectiveness through social network confirmation using available APIs  
         - Customers are incentivized to do so through assurances of frictionless transactions  
         - Provide customers with terms and conditions that guarantee their privacy
