### Monitoring
Transaction monitoring entails the automated or manual review of transactions to identify activity of concern; when appropriate, report it to authorities; and evaluate whether customer relationships should be discontinued (Wolfsberg Group Statement on AML Screening, Monitoring, and Searching, 2009). Company's transaction-monitoring strategy calls for:
- A comprehensive understanding of products offered by Company, which enables identification of their money-laundering vulnerabilities;
- Thorough and clear documentation and governance, which are pillars of a sustainable program; and
- Technologies that can help Company prevent, detect, and report financial crime, mitigate compliance risk, and protect against abuse.

Company's monitoring program targets the interconnectedness of the payment network. 

Company's monitoring program uses a framework based on four concepts:
1. **Typologies**, which are classifications of money-laundering behavior;
2. **Behaviors**, which are a discrete type or set of user-initiated activities;
3. **Red flags**, which are risky behaviors; and
3. **Rules**, which use calculations to generate alerts.

The monitoring process entails:
1. Identifing systems.  
2. Identifing connections between systems.  
3. Defining system participant roles.  
4. Defining normal behavior for each role.  
5. Defining features of each behavior.  
6. Observing user behavior on system.
7. Measuring distance between role behavior and user behavior.
8. Clustering measurements.

9. Creating graph = V(user)-send money->V(user)

    Properties of users = 
    ```
        {
          "unique_id": string,
          "Roles": tuple(string),
          "Feature_scores": tuple(float),
          "money_sent": float,
          "money_received": float,
          "transaction_count": int
        }
     ```  

    Properties of money_send = 
    ```
        {
          "originator_id": string,
          "beneficiary_id": string,
          "transaction_time": timedate,
          "transaction_amt": float
        }
     ```

##### Transactions have shape

Transactions features:
1. Shape (inputs, outputs)
2. Value distribution
3. Input type
4. Input age


##### Implementation Plan
1. Identify threats
2. Document risks
3. Review authoritative sources
4. Review investigations narratives, if any
5. Define typology based on authoritative sources and observed behavior
6. Define features that enable risks
7. Define expected behavior
8. Define risky behavior
9. Choose behavior curve
10. Map behaviors to typologies
11. Draft requirements and logic
12. Build
13. Train
14. Test
15. Generate output
16. Investigate
17. Analyze results
18. Estimate frequency
19. Draft closing memo
20. Review prototype with stakeholders
21. Submit
22. Draft procedures
23. Conduct training
