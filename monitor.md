# Monitor

1. Identify systems.  
2. Identify connections between systems.  
3. Define system participant roles.  
4. Define normal behavior for each role.  
5. What are the features of that behavior?  

6. Observe user behavior on system.
7. Measure distance between role behavior and user behavior.
8. Cluster measurements.

9. Create graph = V(user)-send money->V(user)

    Properties of users = 
    ```
        {
          "unique_id": string,
          "Roles": tuple(string),
          "Feature_scores": tuple(float),
          "money_sent": float,
          "money_received": float,
          "transaction_count": int
        }
     ```  

    Properties of money_send = 
    ```
        {
          "originator_id": string,
          "beneficiary_id": string,
          "transaction_time": timedate,
          "transaction_amt": float
        }
     ```

10. Cluster users by property

### Transactions have shape

Transactions features:
1. Shape (inputs, outputs)
2. Value distribution
3. Input type
4. Input age


### Plan
1. Identify threats
2. Document risks
3. Review authoritative sources
4. Reivew investigations narratives, if any
5. Define typology based on authoritative sources and observed behavior
6. Define features that enable risks
7. Define expected behavior
8. Define risky behavior
9. Choose behavior curve
10. Map behaviors to typologies
11. Draft requirements and logic
12. Build
13. Train
14. Test
15. Generate output
16. Investigate
17. Analyze results
18. Estimate frequency
19. Draft closing memo
20. Review prototype with stakeholders
21. Submit
22. Draft procedures
23. Conduct training
