### Plan
1. Identify threats
2. Document risks
3. Review authoritative sources
4. Reivew investigations narratives, if any
5. Define typology based on authoritative sources and observed behavior
6. Define features that enable risks
7. Define expected behavior
8. Define risky behavior
9. Choose behavior curve
10. Map behaviors to typologies
11. Draft requirements and logic
12. Build
13. Train
14. Test
15. Generate output
16. Investigate
17. Analyze results
18. Estimate frequency
19. Draft closing memo
20. Review prototype with stakeholders
21. Submit
22. Draft procedures
23. Conduct training
